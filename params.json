{"name":"Brightness","tagline":"Brightness Controller","body":"# Brightness Controller\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nBrightness Controller allows you to control Brightness of your **Primary and Secondary Display** with the help of `xrandr` in Linux. It is a software based dimmer. The controller is created using Python, which in the back end calls `os.system` commands to execute system commands.\r\n\r\n## What good is it?\r\n\r\nIt allows you to control the brightness of your monitor to a better extent. For example, my laptop's monitor brightness can be controlled using hardware keys at discrete values, such as 20%, 40%, 60%, ... 100%. Brightness Controller allows you to change the brightness to a better degree of control, ranging from 1% to 100%! It should be mentioned that it changes the present brightness value set via hardware control of your monitor. For example, if you set your Monitor's brightness to 50% using hardware buttons, then that will be the 100% value in Brightness controller. \r\n\r\n## Installation \r\n\r\nThere are various options available.\r\nThe Debian, RPM and Ubuntu Software Center method gives you the last updated packages, whereas the bash script and the source method gives you the latest stable version of Brightnes Controller.\r\n\r\n- [Ubuntu Software Center](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/brightness-controller/)\r\n- [Debian](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/brightness_1.0_all.deb?w=AACghuGBHKdubl0-3npV9RphiYyiMhNGyy-vA5ZBeadXlQ&dl=1)\r\n- [Experimental RPM](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/brightness-1.0-2.noarch.rpm?w=AABT4bXl_KuZxAVrMx2xEduZuk1GSjGR5t_9dNTsyEDFSA&dl=1)\r\n- [Good old bash script](https://gist.github.com/lordamit/6134441)\r\n\r\nYou can also run it directly by downloading the source code.\r\n\r\n- Download the [Latest version](https://github.com/lordamit/Brightness/archive/master.zip) to your home folder.\r\n- Extract it.\r\n- Open the `src/brightness.desktop` with your favourite text editor.\r\n- Replace `path/to...` with the original path of `brightness.py` in line 4 and `brightness.svg` in line 7.\r\n- Now `brightness.desktop` looks like 'Brightness Controller' and should have an icon.\r\n- Double-click Brightness Controller and the app should run.\r\n\r\n## What are the requirements / dependencies / things I need to run it?\r\n\r\nThree dependencies only.\r\n\r\n1. Python - Linux should have it by default\r\n\r\n2. Python WxWidgets\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8\r\n```\r\n3. `xrandr` - that's what the program uses in the backend to control the brightness of your monitor!\r\n\r\n## It doesn't detect my displays properly\r\n\r\nKindly make an issue in the GitHub project and submit the output of this command:\r\n```bash\r\n$ xrandr -q\r\n```\r\n\r\n## I have more than two displays, and this program only shows two. What's happening?\r\n\r\nIn a word, *jealousy*. Because I never had more than two displays simultaneously, I decided to give support for up to two displays only. So no, it can not support your third (or fourth, or fifth...) display.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Brightness Controller screenshot](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2829/9290314985_725f94cb98.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nRandom questions that might show up here are answered here in advance.\r\n\r\n## The coding style is not exactly... Python-like\r\n \r\nBecause it is my first Python code that exceeds 10 lines. I have not used Python before, but I decided to use it for this project for no particular reason.\r\n\r\n## Why is it here?\r\n\r\nI wrote it because I could not find any other similar software available **in Linux** that provides an easy to use UI for changing brightness. There are still room for improvement, specially in the coding style. I hope due to its open source nature, people will come forward and will help it become a better brightness controller.\r\n\r\n## Help! It broke my computer!\r\n\r\n*Erm, that's not exactly supposed to happen. Still, use at your own risk. I won't allow myself to be held responsible even if it turns your display into a black hole, sucks you in and kills you in the process.  \r\nBut still, let me know if something goes wrong by reporting it in the issues section.*\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, Brightness Controller does nothing that can break your computer. It simply provides a graphical user interface you can use with a mouse to control brightness easily. It does not execute any command or does not do anything to change your system. So, feel free to use it. :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
