# Brightness Controller

his is version 2 of Brightness Controller. It's only for testing.

## Dependencies

Not sure about all dependencies, but this is one of them:

- python-pyside
 
## Features

v2 is very stable so far, but there are some features that aren't finished.

1. Checking for updates
2. Saving color profile
3. Loading color profile

It should be mentioned that even though I am calling it save and load color profile, I am not sure if it *is* actually called color profile. It will simply change the RGB ratios in you display, completely like the color temperature feature.

## Bugs

Please test v2. Reporting bugs is appreciated.
