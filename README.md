Brightness
==========

Brigheness Controller allows you to control Brightness of your internal and external monitor with the help of xrandr in Linux. The controller is created using python, which in the backend calls os.system commands to execute system commands.

I wrote it because I could not find any other similar software available in Linux that provides an easy to use UI for changing brigthness. There are still rooms for improvement, specially in the coding style. I hope due to its open source nature, people will come forward and will help it become a better brightness controller.
