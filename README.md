# Brightness Controller - Development Branch

Everything to be declared. THIS IS NOT FOR GENERAL PEOPLE. Use only for testing.

For now, just test. 

I forgot the dependencies I had to install, but here is one I can remember:

- python-pyside

Please install it using your own distribution commands.

At present, Brightness Controller v2.0 is stable, and functionalities are complete except the given ones below:

1. Checking for updates
2. Saving color profile
3. Loading color profile

It should be mentioned that even though I am calling it save / load color profile, I am not sure if it *is* actually called color profile.
It will simply change the RGB ratios in you display, completely like the color temperature feature.

Please test, and report issues in the Issues section.
